  abstract = {Our judgment of a target is influenced by its context. So is it for the judgment of facial attractiveness. The current research aimed to explore when there were multiple social groups in the context, how faces of different social groups affected the attractiveness of an individual face, resulting in varying degrees of cheerleader effect. We presented the target face individually or in the context containing two social groups: both the own group and the other group of the target face and manipulated the context into five conditions: HOHT (high attractive own group and high attractive other group), HOLT (high attractive own group and low attractive other group), LOHT (low attractive own group and high attractive other group), LOLT (low attractive own group and low attractive other group), ALONE (no surrounding faces). Target faces were nine faces with continuously increasing attractiveness. We used Black female faces and White female faces as two social groups in Experiment 1a and 2a, and Asian female faces and White female faces in Experiment 1b and 2b. The task in Experiment 1 was to judge whether the target face in each context was attractive or unattractive. The task in Experiment 2 was to rate the attractiveness of the target face in each context. Both experiments showed the contrast effect that the attractiveness of target faces increased significantly in LOLT, with ALONE as the baseline. Besides, Experiment 2 showed that the attractiveness increment of the target face in LOHT and HOLT was also significant with the effect in LOLT being greater than that in LOHT which was greater than that in HOLT. Our results indicated that low attractive surrounding faces increased the attractiveness of the target face, and the weight of the own group was greater than that of the other group.},

  abstract = {In recent years, short-form videos have been exploding on social media. People are addicted to taking vibrant, dynamic selfie videos instead of static selfies. We hypothesized that it is the vividness in videos, compared with static pictures, making people more appealing. Therefore, the present research aimed to investigate whether vitality made dynamic faces more attractive than static ones. We obtained face stimuli from social networks and generated them into three different motion state faces (dynamic, static, and dynamic faces played in scrambled frames). Participants rated the attractiveness (Experiment 1&2), vitality (Experiment 1&2), and subjective processing fluency (Experiment 2) of these faces and were primed with different labels of vitality (high, low, and non) in Experiment 2. As expected, dynamic faces had greater vitality and higher attractiveness than static ones. High-vitality labels made faces more attractive than low-vitality labels. Furthermore, vitality rather than subjective processing fluency mediated the relationship between motion states and facial attractiveness. In Experiment 3, we further examined whether the vitality effect could be generalized to other stimuli. We adopted videos of humans, plants, animals, and inanimate objects as stimuli and generated them into two motion states (dynamic and static). Again, we found vitality mediated the relationship between motion states and facial attractiveness regardless of stimuli type. These results indicate that vitality is an essential factor that accounts for the more attractiveness of dynamic stimuli than static ones.},

  booktitle = {International Joint Forum of Psychological and Cognitive Sciences, Peking University},
  year = {2021},
  month = {April},
  abstract = {There are mixed findings regarding whether and how symmetry influences facial attractiveness. The present study introduced “facial normality” to explain this inconsistency and hypothesized that symmetry increased facial attractiveness only when it improves facial normality. The authors manipulated symmetry and normality simultaneously on sixteen Chinese male faces and asked participants to rate the perceived symmetry, perceived normality, and facial attractiveness. The results demonstrated an interactive effect of symmetry and normality on facial attractiveness. The structural equation model showed perceived normality acted as a mediator between symmetry and facial attractiveness. The present study explains the different effects of symmetry on facial attractiveness in previous studies and highlights the mediating role of normality.},
