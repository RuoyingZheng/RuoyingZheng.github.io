  abstract = {Traitimpressions are ubiquitous and shape consequential decisions.Prior work investigated what information people used for traitimpressions using artificial designs.To advance a naturalistic understanding, we applied novel computational tools to quantify comprehensive cuesbased onprior theories(facial, bodily, clothing, environmental cues) (Study 1) and manipulate individual cues realistically (Study 2) in naturalistic images. Across two pre-registered studies (N1= 2,435 U.S. representative; N2= 569), we found that with rich information available, the cues predicting traitimpressions were sparse. We confirmed for a subset of cues that these predictionswere causal. Predictivecues carriedunique information beyond the consistent information shared with other available cues. Unpredictive cues played a role by shapingthe utilization of predictive cues through interactions. Together, ourfindings suggest that the mind may have evolvedto utilize the naturalistic relations between cues to simplify what information to attend to when forming trait impressions.},
