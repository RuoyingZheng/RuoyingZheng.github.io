Humans can compute summary statistics for a set of stimuli, referred to as ensemble perception (see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-010416-044232" target="_blank">Whitney & Yamanashi Leib, 2018</a> for a review). The calculated mean value may bias towards attended items (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797620943834" target="_blank">Choi & Chong, 2020</a>).

I am interested in <strong>how attention modulates the  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ensemble perception</code> of face identities and how people create the average face for attended faces and unattended faces</strong>.

Besides, scenarios of social interaction are everywhere in our daily life. <strong>How do people recognize  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">socially interacting</code> faces, and whether this social interaction improves or impairs face recognition?</strong> We are using drift difussion model to explore these questions.
