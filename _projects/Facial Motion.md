What makes a creation attract the beholders?

Socrates declared that the faithful imitation of the various affections of the body action imparts a particular pleasure to the beholder, and this imitation brings the statues to life (<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1177/1177-h/1177-h.htm" target="_blank">Xenophon, 2004/2013</a>).

Looking back at the history of aesthetics, beauty seems to go beyond appearance to the spirit behind appearance, shown by portraying body movements (<a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%E7%BE%8E%E7%9A%84%E6%AD%B7%E5%8F%B2" target="_blank">Eco, 2004/2007</a>).

I am interested in this beauty of dynamism and its underlying mechanism, and I am currently focusing on the role of vitality (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1167/jov.21.9.2361" target="_blank">Zheng & Zhou, 2021</a>) and attention in it (see <a href="https://doi.org/10.3724/SP.J.1042.2022.01429" target="_blank"> Zhou et al., 2022</a> for the conceptual framework).
