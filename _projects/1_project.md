Individuals are more attractive in a group than in isolation (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797613497969" target="_blank">Walker & Vul, 2014</a>) , which reflects the influence of the social context on facial attractiveness. However, the social groups in the real world are diverse, with different genders, ages, races, etc. There are various relations between these social groups. Therefore, I am curious about how the context with multiple social groups and the triadic relations of the observer, target, and context influence attractiveness perception.
