<strong>Hi</strong>, thanks for visiting! ðŸ‘‹

I am Ruoying Zheng (éƒ‘è‹¥é¢–), an incoming Phd student in the in the <a href="https://impactlab-ucsd.github.io/" target="_blank"> IMPACT Lab</a>at the 
UC San Diego, supervised by Dr. Chujun Lin. I am now a Research Assistant in the <a href="https://www.psychology.hku.hk/scnlab/home.html" target="_blank"> Social & Cognitive Neuroscience Lab</a> at the University of Hong Kong, working with Dr. Xiaoqing Hu. Prior to this, I obtained a Master's degree in Psychology from <a href="https://www.sysu.edu.cn/sysuen/" target="_blank">Sun Yat-sen University</a>, supervised by <a href="https://m.x-mol.com/groups/zhou_guomei" target="_blank">Dr. Guomei Zhou</a> and completed my undergraduate studies in Intellectual Property and Computer Science at <a href="https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/" target="_blank">South China University of Technology</a>.

I am fascinated by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">social cognition</code>. As social animals, we encounter a myriad of people every day. How do we form first impressions of others via their faces and thus influence our subsequent social behaviors? How is this process affected by motion cues and social context? I currently combine behavioral experiments and computational modeling to explore these questions.

In my spare time, I enjoy writing, hiking, and photography. You can view some of my photography work <a href="https://ruoyingzheng.github.io/Miscellany/gallery-index" target="_blank">here</a>.
