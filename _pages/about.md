<strong>Hi</strong>, thanks for visiting! ðŸ‘‹

This is Ruoying Zheng (éƒ‘è‹¥é¢–), a 1st year PhD student in the <a href="https://impactlab-ucsd.github.io/" target="_blank">IMPACT Lab</a> at UC San Diego, supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jOyTedwAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Dr. Chujun Lin</a>. Previously, I worked as a research assistant in the <a href="https://www.psychology.hku.hk/scnlab/home.html" target="_blank"> Social & Cognitive Neuroscience Lab</a> at the University of Hong Kong, supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SxV9Em8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao"  target="_blank">Dr. Xiaoqing Hu</a>. I obtained a Master's degree in Psychology from Sun Yat-sen University, supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4enh0nMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_blank">Dr. Guomei Zhou</a> and completed my undergraduate studies in Intellectual Property and Computer Science at South China University of Technology.

I am fascinated by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">social cognition</code>. As social animals, we encounter a myriad of people every day. How do we form first impressions of others via their faces and thus influence our subsequent social behaviors? How is this process affected by motion cues and social context? I currently combine behavioral experiments and computational modeling to explore these questions.

In my spare time, I enjoy writing, hiking, and photography. You can view some of my photography work <a href="https://ruoyingzheng.github.io/Miscellany/gallery-index" target="_blank">here</a>.
